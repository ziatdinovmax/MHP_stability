Code and data for [High-Throughput Study of Antisolvents on the Stability of Multicomponent Metal Halide
Perovskites through Robotics-Based Synthesis and Machine Learning Approaches](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03312.pdf) paper.

The codes were written by Kate Higgins at the University of Tennessee Knoxville. I am just merely posting them online as a co-author (with everyone's agreement, obviously).
